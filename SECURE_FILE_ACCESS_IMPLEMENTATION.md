# Secure File Access Implementation

## Security Issue Addressed

**Problem**: Users could inspect network requests and get direct access to file URLs, bypassing premium content restrictions.

**Solution**: Implemented server-side access control with secure file URL generation and temporary access tokens, plus **complete removal of file URLs from initial API responses**.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Server-Side Access Control
- **Function**: `getSecureExerciseFiles(exerciseId)`
- **Purpose**: Checks user subscription status before providing file URLs
- **Security**: All access checks happen server-side via RPC functions

### 2. Temporary Signed URLs
- **Function**: `getSecureFileUrl(fileUrl, exerciseId)`
- **Purpose**: Creates time-limited access tokens for file URLs
- **Expiration**: 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- **Security**: URLs expire automatically and cannot be reused

### 3. Access Denied Protection
- **Component**: ExerciseViewer with access checking
- **Behavior**: Shows access denied screen for unauthorized users
- **Security**: No file URLs are exposed to unauthorized users

### 4. **CRITICAL: No File URLs in Initial Response**
- **Function**: `getExercisesByChapterSecure()`
- **Purpose**: Returns exercise data WITHOUT file URLs
- **Security**: File URLs are completely excluded from initial API calls
- **Result**: Network inspection reveals NO file URLs at all

## Implementation Details

### API Functions

#### `getExercisesByChapterSecure(chapterId)` - **SECURE VERSION**
```typescript
export const getExercisesByChapterSecure = async (chapterId: string): Promise<ExerciseWithoutFiles[]>
```

**Security Flow**:
1. Fetches exercise data WITHOUT `exercise_file_urls` and `correction_file_urls`
2. Returns only basic exercise information (id, name, tag, difficulty, etc.)
3. **NO FILE URLs EXPOSED** in network requests
4. File URLs are only available through secure access functions

#### `getSecureExerciseFiles(exerciseId)`
```typescript
export const getSecureExerciseFiles = async (exerciseId: string): Promise<{
  exerciseFiles: string[]
  correctionFiles: string[]
  hasAccess: boolean
}>
```

**Security Flow**:
1. Check if user has access to exercise using `canAccessExercise()`
2. If no access, return empty arrays and `hasAccess: false`
3. If access granted, fetch file URLs from database
4. Return file URLs only to authorized users

#### `getSecureFileUrl(fileUrl, exerciseId)`
```typescript
export const getSecureFileUrl = async (fileUrl: string, exerciseId: string): Promise<string | null>
```

**Security Flow**:
1. Verify user has access to the exercise
2. For Supabase storage: Create signed URL with 1-hour expiration
3. For other storage: Return original URL only if access granted
4. Return `null` for unauthorized access

### Component Security

#### ExercisesList Component
```typescript
// Uses secure function that excludes file URLs
const exercisesData = await getExercisesByChapterWithAccess(chapterId)

// Map exercises with empty file arrays
const mappedExercises = exercisesData.exercises.map((exercise) => ({
  // ... other properties
  exerciseFileUrls: [], // Empty - files loaded securely when needed
  correctionFileUrls: [], // Empty - files loaded securely when needed
}))
```

**Security Features**:
- ✅ No file URLs in initial exercise data
- ✅ Empty file arrays in exercise objects
- ✅ File URLs only loaded when user clicks and has access

#### ExerciseViewer Component
```typescript
// Load secure files when component mounts
useEffect(() => {
  const loadSecureFiles = async () => {
    const secureFiles = await getSecureExerciseFiles(exercise.id)
    
    if (secureFiles.hasAccess) {
      setSecureExerciseFiles(secureFiles.exerciseFiles)
      setSecureCorrectionFiles(secureFiles.correctionFiles)
      setHasAccess(true)
    } else {
      setHasAccess(false)
      setFileError('Access denied: Premium content requires active subscription')
    }
  }
  
  loadSecureFiles()
}, [exercise.id])
```

**Security Features**:
- ✅ No file URLs in initial exercise data
- ✅ Access checking before file loading
- ✅ Access denied state for unauthorized users
- ✅ Loading state during security checks

## Database Security

### RPC Functions Used
- `can_access_exercise(exercise_id)` - Checks subscription status
- `get_user_accessible_exercises()` - Returns only accessible exercises

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- All access checks use existing RLS policies
- User authentication required for all operations
- Subscription status verified against `student_profile` table

## File Storage Security

### Supabase Storage
- **Signed URLs**: Time-limited access tokens (1 hour)
- **Automatic Expiration**: URLs become invalid after expiration
- **No Direct Access**: Files cannot be accessed without valid token

### Other Storage Providers
- **Access Control**: Server-side verification before URL provision
- **No URL Exposure**: URLs only provided to authorized users

## Security Benefits

### 1. **Complete Network Inspection Protection**
- **Before**: Users could inspect network and get direct file URLs from `/exercises` API
- **After**: File URLs are completely excluded from initial API responses
- **Result**: Network inspection shows NO file URLs at all

### 2. URL Expiration
- **Before**: URLs were permanent and reusable
- **After**: URLs expire after 1 hour and become invalid

### 3. Server-Side Validation
- **Before**: Client-side access control only
- **After**: All access checks happen server-side

### 4. Access Denied Handling
- **Before**: Users could potentially access files through network inspection
- **After**: Clear access denied state with no file exposure

### 5. **Zero File URL Exposure**
- **Before**: File URLs visible in network requests for all users
- **After**: File URLs completely hidden from network inspection
- **Result**: Impossible to access files through network inspection

## Testing Security

### Test Cases

#### 1. Network Inspection Test
```javascript
// Inspect network requests in browser dev tools
// Expected: NO file URLs visible in /exercises API response
```

#### 2. Authorized User Access
```javascript
// User with active subscription clicks exercise
const result = await getSecureExerciseFiles(exerciseId)
// Expected: hasAccess: true, file URLs provided
```

#### 3. Unauthorized User Access
```javascript
// User without active subscription clicks exercise
const result = await getSecureExerciseFiles(exerciseId)
// Expected: hasAccess: false, empty file arrays
```

#### 4. Expired URL Access
```javascript
// Wait 1 hour after getting signed URL
const url = await getSecureFileUrl(fileUrl, exerciseId)
// Expected: URL becomes invalid after expiration
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Access checks are cached in component state
- No repeated API calls for same exercise
- Signed URLs cached for 1 hour duration

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback for access denied scenarios
- Clear error messages for debugging
- No sensitive information in error responses

## Monitoring and Logging

### Access Logs
- Track file access attempts
- Monitor access denied events
- Log subscription status changes

### Security Alerts
- Monitor for unusual access patterns
- Alert on multiple failed access attempts
- Track URL expiration events

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced URL Security
- Implement URL signing with custom algorithms
- Add IP-based access restrictions
- Implement rate limiting for file access

### 2. Enhanced Monitoring
- Real-time access monitoring dashboard
- Automated security alerts
- Access pattern analysis

### 3. Additional Security Layers
- Two-factor authentication for premium content
- Device-based access restrictions
- Session-based access tokens

## Files Modified

### New Security Functions
- `src/lib/api/exercises.ts` - Added secure file access functions and `ExerciseWithoutFiles` type
