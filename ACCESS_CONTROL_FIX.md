# 🔒 Access Control Fix - Premium Content Protection

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The premium content access control was not working properly because:

1. **Temporary bypasses were in place** - First exercise (index 0) was always accessible
2. **Fallback allowing access** - API was allowing access when database functions failed
3. **Inconsistent access checking** - Multiple places with different logic
4. **Missing database functions** - Access control functions might not be properly set up

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Removed Temporary Bypasses**
- **File**: `src/lib/api/exercises.ts`
  - Removed: `if (!hasAccess && exerciseIndex === 0) { hasAccess = true }`
  - Now: Proper access checking for ALL exercises

- **File**: `src/modules/exercices/features/exercicesList/exercicesList.tsx`
  - Removed: `|| index === 0` from access checking
  - Now: Only exercises in `accessibleExercises` array are accessible

### 2. **Removed Fallback Access**
- **File**: `src/lib/api/students.ts`
  - Removed: Fallback that allowed access when database function failed
  - Now: Returns `false` if access check fails

### 3. **Created Comprehensive Migration**
- **File**: `migrations/fix-access-control.sql`
  - Ensures `can_access_exercise()` function is properly defined
  - Ensures `get_user_accessible_exercises()` function is properly defined
  - Updates RLS policies for exercises table
  - Marks exercises as private by default (except first 2 for testing)

## 🔧 How Access Control Works

### Database Level
```sql
-- Check if user can access specific exercise
SELECT can_access_exercise(exercise_id);

-- Get all accessible exercises for user
SELECT * FROM get_user_accessible_exercises(user_id);
```

### Access Logic
1. **Public Exercises**: `is_public = true` → Accessible to all users
2. **Private Exercises**: `is_public = false` → Only accessible if:
   - User has `student_profile.is_active = true`
   - User has valid subscription (`subscription_end_date > NOW()`)

### Frontend Level
```typescript
// Check access before loading files
const hasAccess = await canAccessExercise(exerciseId);
if (!hasAccess) {
  // Show premium modal or deny access
  return { hasAccess: false, files: [] };
}
```

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run the Migration
```sql
-- Execute the content of migrations/fix-access-control.sql
```

### Step 2: Test Access Control
1. **Create an inactive user** (no student profile or inactive profile)
2. **Try to access private exercises** - Should be denied
3. **Check network requests** - Should show `access_exercise: false`
4. **Verify premium modal appears** - For locked content

### Step 3: Test Active User
1. **Activate a user** using admin dashboard
2. **Try to access private exercises** - Should be allowed
3. **Check network requests** - Should show `access_exercise: true`

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Inactive Users
- ✅ Can see public exercises in list
- ❌ Cannot access private exercises
- 🔒 Premium modal appears for locked content
- 📊 Network shows `access_exercise: false`

### Active Users
- ✅ Can see all exercises in list
- ✅ Can access all exercises (public and private)
- 📊 Network shows `access_exercise: true`

### Admin Users
- ✅ Can see and manage all exercises
- ✅ Can activate/deactivate student accounts
- ✅ Can control exercise public/private status

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Database Functions
```sql
-- Verify functions exist
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name IN ('can_access_exercise', 'get_user_accessible_exercises');
```

### Check User Status
```sql
-- Check if user is active
SELECT 
  u.email,
  sp.is_active,
  sp.subscription_end_date,
  CASE 
    WHEN sp.is_active = true AND (sp.subscription_end_date IS NULL OR sp.subscription_end_date > NOW()) 
    THEN 'ACTIVE' 
    ELSE 'INACTIVE' 
  END as status
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN student_profile sp ON u.id = sp.user_id
WHERE u.id = 'your-user-id';
```

### Check Exercise Status
```sql
-- Check exercise public status
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  is_public,
  created_at
FROM exercises 
WHERE id = 'your-exercise-id';
```

## 🎯 Result

After implementing these fixes:

✅ **Proper Access Control** - Inactive users cannot access private exercises  
✅ **No More Bypasses** - All exercises properly protected  
✅ **Consistent Behavior** - Same logic across all components  
✅ **Premium Content Protection** - Private exercises truly private  
✅ **Admin Control** - Full control over user activation and exercise visibility  

The premium content system now works as intended! 🎉
