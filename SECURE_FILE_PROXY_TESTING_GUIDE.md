# Secure File Proxy Testing Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The secure file proxy has been successfully implemented with the following components:

1. **Supabase Edge Function**: `secure-file-proxy` - Handles authentication and file serving
2. **Custom Hook**: `useSecureFileLoader` - Fetches files with authentication and creates blob URLs
3. **Updated ExerciseViewer**: Uses the secure file loader instead of direct URLs
4. **Updated API**: `getSecureProxyUrls` - Returns proxy URLs instead of direct file URLs

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
The server should start without errors at `http://localhost:4001/`

### Step 2: Test the Exercise Viewer

1. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:4001/`
2. **Login** with a user account that has access to exercises
3. **Navigate to an exercise** (go to a chapter and click on an exercise)
4. **Open Developer Tools** (F12) and go to the **Network** tab

### Step 3: Verify Network Requests

**What you should see in the Network tab:**

✅ **Correct Implementation:**
```
Network Tab Shows:
├── /functions/v1/secure-file-proxy?exerciseId=123&type=exercise&index=0
│   └── Response: File content (no URLs exposed)
└── /functions/v1/secure-file-proxy?exerciseId=123&type=correction&index=0
    └── Response: File content (no URLs exposed)
```

❌ **If you still see direct URLs:**
```
Network Tab Shows:
├── /rest/v1/exercises?select=exercise_file_urls,correction_file_urls
│   └── Response: {
│       exercise_file_urls: ["https://supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/exercise-files/..."]
│       correction_file_urls: ["https://supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/correction-files/..."]
│   }
```

### Step 4: Check File Loading

1. **Verify PDF files load correctly** in the exercise viewer
2. **Test both exercise and correction files**
3. **Check that files display properly** without errors

### Step 5: Test Authentication

1. **Try accessing without login** - should show authentication errors
2. **Test with unauthorized users** - should show access denied
3. **Verify authorized users** can access files normally

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Browser Console
Look for any error messages related to:
- File loading failures
- Authentication errors
- Network request errors

### Check Network Tab
- Verify requests are going to `/functions/v1/secure-file-proxy`
- Check response status codes (should be 200 for successful requests)
- Look for any 401 (unauthorized) or 403 (forbidden) errors

### Check Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Edge Functions
3. Check the logs for the `secure-file-proxy` function
4. Look for any error messages or failed requests

## 🎯 Expected Results

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Network tab shows proxy URLs instead of direct storage URLs
- PDF files load and display correctly
- No authentication errors for authorized users
- Access denied for unauthorized users
- No direct file URLs visible in network requests

### ❌ Issues to Watch For:
- Files not loading (check console for errors)
- Authentication errors for authorized users
- Network requests still showing direct storage URLs
- 401/403 errors in network tab

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once testing is complete and working:

1. **Deploy to production** when ready
2. **Monitor Edge Function logs** for any issues
3. **Test with different user types** (admin, regular users, etc.)
4. **Verify performance** - files should load with minimal latency

## 📝 Notes

- The implementation uses blob URLs for security
- Files are fetched with authentication headers
- Direct storage URLs are never exposed to the client
- The proxy handles both exercise and correction files
- Access control is enforced server-side

Let me know what you see in the network tab when testing!
